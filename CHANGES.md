Unreleased changes
------------------

### Breaking changes

- Dropped support for Python 3.7. ([#154](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/154))

### Documentation

- Use the `{raw} html :file: _static/charts/<PLOT-ID>.html` directive to load the interactive Plotly graphs in the generated Sphinx docs. The generated HTML artefacts only include a `<div>` wrapper block now and the plotly.min.js is now vendored and automatically loaded via the `html_js_files` Sphinx config. ([#132](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/132))
- Small adjustments to the example plots in the documentation. ([#132](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/132))
- Reformat markdown files, removing all line breaks. ([#132](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/132))

### Internals

- Define a `ridgeplot._missing.MISSING` sentinel object for internal use (this replaces the multiple module-level `_MISSING = object()` sentinels). ([#154](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/154))
- Add an internal `extras/` directory to place helper modules and packages used in different CI tasks. ([#154](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/154) and [#161](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/161))

### CI/CD

- Replace `isort`, `flake8`, and `pyupgrade` with `ruff`. ([#131](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/131))
- Add regression tests for the figure artifacts generated by the examples in `_ridgeplot_examples`. ([#154](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/154))
- Remove the Python locked dependency files. ([#163](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/163))

---

0.1.23
------

- Fix the references to the interactive Plotly IFrames ([#129](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/129))

---

0.1.22
------

### Deprecations

- The `colormode='index'` value has been deprecated in favor of `colormode='row-index'`, which provides the same functionality but is more explicit and allows to distinguish between the `'row-index'` and `'trace-index'` modes. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
- The `show_annotations` argument has been deprecated in favor of `show_yticklabels`. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
- The `get_all_colorscale_names()` function has been deprecated in favor of `list_all_colorscale_names()`. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))

### Features

- Add functionality to allow plotting of multiple traces per row. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
- Add `ridgeplot.datasets.load_lincoln_weather()` helper function to load the "Lincoln Weather" toy dataset. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
- Add more versions of the _probly_ dataset (`"wadefagen"` and `"illinois"`). ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
- Add support for Python 3.11.

### Documentation

- Major update to the documentation, including more examples, interactive plots, script to generate the HTML and WebP images from the example scripts, improved API reference, and more. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))

### Internal

- Remove `mdformat` from the automated CI checks. It can still be triggered manually. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
- Improved type annotations and type checking. ([#114](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/pull/114))
