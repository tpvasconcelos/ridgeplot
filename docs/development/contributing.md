# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ridgeplot! üöÄ

The contribution process for ridgeplot should start with [filing a GitHub issue](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/new/choose). We define three main categories of issues, and each category has its own GitHub issue template

- ‚≠ê Feature requests
- üêõ Bug reports
- üìö Documentation fixes

After the implementation strategy has been agreed on by a ridgeplot contributor, the next step is to introduce your changes as a pull request (see [](#pull-request-workflow)) against the ridgeplot repository. Once your pull request is merged, your changes will be automatically included in the next ridgeplot release. Every change should be listed in the ridgeplot [Changelog](../reference/changelog.md).

The following is a set of (slightly opinionated) rules and general guidelines for contributing to ridgeplot. Emphasis on **guidelines**, not _rules_. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

(Development-environment)=
## Development environment

Here are some guidelines for setting up your development environment. Most of the steps have been abstracted away using the [make](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)>) build automation tool. Feel free to peak inside {{ repo_file('Makefile') }} at any time to see exactly what is being run, and in which order.

First, you will need to [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#step-2-create-a-local-clone-of-your-fork) this repository. For this, make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join), fork ridgeplot to your GitHub account by clicking the [Fork](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/fork) button, and clone the main repository locally (e.g. using SSH)

```shell
git clone git@github.com:tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot.git
cd ridgeplot
```

You will also need to add your fork as a remote to push your work to. Replace `{username}` with your GitHub username.

```shell
git remote add fork git@github.com:{username}/ridgeplot.git
```

The following command will 1) create a new virtual environment (under `.venv`), 2) install ridgeplot in [editable mode](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/#install-editable) (along with all it's dependencies), and 3) set up and install all [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/). Make sure you always work within this virtual environment (i.e., `$ source .venv/bin/activate`). On top of this, you should also set up your IDE to always point to this python interpreter. In PyCharm, open `Preferences -> Project: ridgeplot -> Project Interpreter` and point the python interpreter to `.venv/bin/python`.

```shell
make init
```

The default and **recommended** base python is `python3.8`. You can change this by exporting the `BASE_PYTHON` environment variable:

```shell
BASE_PYTHON=python3.12 make init
```

If you need to use jupyter-lab, you can install all extra requirements, as well as set up the environment and jupyter kernel with

```shell
make init-jupyter
```

## Pull Request Workflow

1. Always confirm that you have properly configured your Git username and email.

   ```shell
   git config --global user.name 'Your name'
   git config --global user.email 'Your email address'
   ```

2. Each release series has its own branch (i.e. `MAJOR.MINOR.x`). If submitting a documentation or bug fix contribution, branch off of the latest release series branch.

   ```shell
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME> origin/x.x.x
   ```

   Otherwise, if submitting a new feature or API change, branch off of the `main` branch

   ```shell
   git fetch origin
   git checkout -b <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME> origin/main
   ```

3. Apply and commit your changes.

4. Include tests that cover any code changes you make, and make sure the test fails without your patch.

5. Add an entry to CHANGES.md summarising the changes in this pull request. The entry should follow the same style and format as other entries, i.e.

   > `- Your summary here. (#XXX)`

   where `#XXX` should link to the relevant pull request. If you think that the changes in this pull request do not warrant a changelog entry, please state it in your pull request's description. In such cases, a maintainer should add a `skip news` label to make CI pass.

6. Make sure all integration approval steps are passing locally (i.e., `tox`).

7. Push your changes to your fork

   ```shell
   git push --set-upstream fork <YOUR-BRANCH-NAME>
   ```

8. [Create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). Remember to update the pull request's description with relevant notes on the changes implemented, and to [link to relevant issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) (e.g., `fixes #XXX` or `closes #XXX`).

9. Wait for all remote CI checks to pass and for a ridgeplot contributor to approve your pull request.

## Continuous Integration

From GitHub's [Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Fundamentals](https://resources.github.com/ci-cd/):

> _Continuous Integration (CI) automatically builds, tests, and **integrates** code changes within a shared repository._

The first step to Continuous Integration (CI) is having a version control system (VCS) in place. Luckily, you don't have to worry about that! As you have already noticed, we use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and host on [GitHub](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot).

On top of this, we also run a series of integration approval steps that allow us to ship code changes faster and more reliably. In order to achieve this, we run automated tests and coverage reports, as well as syntax (and type) checkers, code style formatters, and dependency vulnerability scans.

### Running it locally

Our tool of choice to configure and reliably run all integration approval steps is [Tox](https://github.com/tox-dev/tox), which allows us to run each step in reproducible isolated virtual environments. To trigger all checks in parallel, simply run:

```shell
tox -p -m static tests
```

It's that simple üôå !! Note only that this will take a while the first time you run the command, since it will have to create all the required virtual environments (along with their dependencies) for each CI step.

The configuration for Tox can be found in {{ repo_file('tox.ini') }}.

#### Tests and coverage reports

We use [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) as our testing framework, and [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to track and measure code coverage. You can find all configuration details in {{ repo_file('tox.ini') }}. To trigger all tests, simply run

```shell
tox -p -m tests
```

If you need more control over which tests are running, or which flags are being passed to pytest, you can also invoke `pytest` directly which will run on your current virtual environment. Configuration details can be found in {{ repo_file('tox.ini') }}.

#### Linting

This project uses [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to check and automatically fix any formatting rules. These checks are triggered before creating any git commit. To manually trigger all linting steps (i.e., all pre-commit hooks), run

```shell
pre-commit run --all-files
```

For more information on which hooks will run, have a look inside the {{ repo_file('.pre-commit-config.yaml') }} configuration file. If you want to manually trigger individual hooks, you can invoke the `pre-commit`script directly. If you need even more control over the tools used you could also invoke them directly (e.g., `isort .`). Remember however that this is **not** the recommended approach.

### GitHub Actions

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automatically run all integration approval steps defined with Tox on every push or pull request event. These checks run on all major operating systems and all supported Python versions. Finally, the generated coverage reports are uploaded to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) and [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/). Check {{ repo_file('.github/workflows/ci.yaml') }} for more details.

### Tools and software

Here is a quick overview of all CI tools and software in use, some of which have already been discussed in the sections above.

## Release process

You need push access to the project's repository to make releases. The following release steps are here for reference only.

1. Review the `## Unreleased changes` section in CHANGES.md by checking for consistency in format and, if necessary, refactoring related entries into relevant subsections (e.g. _Features_, _Docs_, _Bugfixes_, _Security_, etc.). Take a look at previous release notes for guidance and try to keep it consistent.
2. Submit a pull request with these changes only and use the `"Cleanup release notes for X.X.X release"` template for the pull request title. ridgeplot uses the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) versioning standard. You can determine the latest release version by running `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` on the `main` branch. Based on this, you can determine the next release version by incrementing the MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH. More on this on the next section. For now, just make sure you merge this pull request into the `main` branch before continuing.
3. Use the [bumpversion](https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion) utility to bump the current version. This utility will automatically bump the current version, and issue a relevant commit and git tag. E.g.,
   ```shell
   # Bump MAJOR version (e.g., 0.4.2 -> 1.0.0)
   bumpversion major

   # Bump MINOR version (e.g., 0.4.2 -> 0.5.0)
   bumpversion minor

   # Bump PATCH version (e.g., 0.4.2 -> 0.4.3)
   bumpversion patch
   ```
   You can always perform a dry-run to see what will happen under the hood.
   ```shell
   bumpversion --dry-run --verbose [--allow-dirty] [major,minor,patch]
   ```
4. Push your changes along with all tag references:
   ```shell
   git push && git push --tags
   ```
5. At this point a couple of GitHub Actions workflows will be triggered:
    1. `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`: Runs all CI checks with Tox against the new changes pushed to `main`.
    2. `.github/workflows/release.yaml`: Issues a new GitHub release triggered by the new git tag pushed in the previous step.
    3. `.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yaml`: Builds, packages, and uploads the source and wheel package to PyPI (and test PyPI). This is triggered by the new GitHub release created in the previous step.
6. **Trust but verify!**
    1. Verify that all three workflows passed successfully: <https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/actions>
    2. Verify that the new git tag is present in the remote repository: <https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/tags>
    3. Verify that the new release is present in the remote repository and that the release notes were correctly parsed: <https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/releases>
    4. Verify that the new package is available in PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/ridgeplot/>
    5. Verify that the docs were updated and published to <https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>
