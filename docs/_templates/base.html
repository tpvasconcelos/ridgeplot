  {#
    The 'furo' theme places the JS files in `html_js_files` at the bottom of
    the page. This is not ideal for Plotly.js, which needs to be loaded before
    the Plotly charts are rendered. The workaround is to inject Plotly.js into
    the `extrahead` Sphinx block, which is placed at the bottom of the head
    section at the top of the page.
