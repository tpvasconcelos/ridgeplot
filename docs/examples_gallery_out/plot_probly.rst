probly dataset
=================

In this example, we will be replicating the first ridgeline plot example in
`this _from Data to Viz_ post <https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/ridgeline.html>`_
, which uses the _probly_ dataset. You can find the _plobly_ dataset on
multiple sources like in the
`bokeh <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bokeh/bokeh/main/bokeh/sampledata/_data/probly.csv>`_
python interactive visualization library. I'll be using the
`same source <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/probly.csv>`_
used in the original post.

Let's grab only the subset of columns displayed in the example

Not only does 'ridgeplot(...)' come configured with sensible defaults
but is also fully configurable to your own style and preference!

    fig = ridgeplot(
        # Get your samples in the correct format
        samples=df.values.T,
        # We can specify the bandwidth used for KDE
        bandwidth=4,
        # and the range of points for which the KDE is evaluated

        colorscale="viridis",
