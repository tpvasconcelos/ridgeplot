# Run all CI checks on all pushes to the main branch or pull-request updates.
# This includes running static checks such as linting and type checking,
# as well as running the test suite on all supported Python versions.
# Coverage reports will be uploaded to Codecov and Codacy.
#
# The documentation will also be built, and a link to the docs will be
# added to the PR description.
