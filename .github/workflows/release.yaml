# This workflow builds source (sdist) and binary (wheel) distributions
# for the Python package on every push event, followed by publishing
# them to TestPyPi. This should be a good indicator that the build
# and publishing process is always working correctly (as opposed
# to only finding out when we actually want to publish a new
# release).
#
# When new tags are pushed - in addition to the steps above -
# we also publish the build distributions to the "real" PyPi
# repository, and publish a new GitHub Release containing
# the latest section extracted from the release notes
# and the Sigstore-certified built distributions.
