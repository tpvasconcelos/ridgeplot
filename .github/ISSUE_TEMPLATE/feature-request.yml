        **Thank you for your interest in improving ridgeplot!** 🚀

        We really appreciate you taking the time to help make this project better for everyone.

        We organize issues into three main categories:
        - ⭐ **Feature request**: Have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to existing functionality? Share it with us!
        - 🐛 **Bug report**: Encountered a problem or noticed something not working as expected? Please let us know.
        - 📚 **Documentation improvement**: Spotted a typo, missing info, or have suggestions for a new section or example? We'd love to hear about it.

        Looks like you're about to submit a feature request.
        Please use the template below and provide as much detail as you can.
        The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and evaluate your suggestion.

        If possible and relevant, please consider how this feature might impact ridgeplot’s current architecture and API.
        We’ll need to take into account things like backward compatibility, potential documentation updates, and the long-term maintainability of the project.

        For broader discussions, questions, or general feedback, please head over to [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/discussions).

        Our response times may vary, but we'll get back to you as soon as we can!

      placeholder: >
        Please provide a detailed description of the feature or enhancement you are suggesting.

        Instead of focusing solely on _how_ to implement it, explain your motivation, use-case, the problem you're facing, and what you're trying to achieve.
        This context will help us better understand your needs and collaborate on finding the best solution.

        If you have example plots or a vision for what the output should look like (even if it's just a rough sketch or mockup), feel free to attach them here.
        You can easily upload files by dragging and dropping them into this area.

        This section is optional, but if you have thoughts on how this enhancement could be implemented, feel free to share them here.

        For instance, even if you just have an idea for how the API could look like from the user's perspective, you could provide a code snippet like:
        ```python
        import ridgeplot

        fig = ridgeplot("<Your API suggestion here>")
        # etc...
        ```

        Providing sample code can help us better understand your vision and jumpstart discussions around potential solutions.

      placeholder: >
        This section is also optional but, if applicable, consider how this change might impact ridgeplot’s current architecture, API, and user experience.

        Considerations around backward compatibility, documentation updates, and long-term maintainability will have to be taken into account by the maintainers before implementing the feature.
