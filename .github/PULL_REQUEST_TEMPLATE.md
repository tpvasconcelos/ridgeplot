-->

- [ ] Read the [contributing guidelines](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/contributing.html).
  - You don't have to read the whole thing, but it's a good idea to skim it. And definitely take a look at it if you're experiencing any issues getting your local environment up and running.
- [ ] Provided the relevant details in the PR's description.
- [ ] Referenced relevant issues in the PR's description.
- [ ] Added tests for all my changes.
  - The CI will fail unless 100% of all new code is covered by the tests.
- [ ] Updated the docs for relevant changes.
  - [ ] New modules (or renamed ones) are included in `docs/api/internal/`.
  - [ ] New public functions/classes/variables are documented in `docs/api/index.rst`.
  - [ ] Added the appropriate `versionadded`, `versionchanged`, or `deprecated` [directives](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/markup/para.html#directive-versionadded) to docstrings.
    - The version should be the next release version, which you can infer by bumping the minor version in `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., if the current version is `0.2.3`, the next release will be `0.3.0`).
- [ ] Changes are documented in `docs/reference/changelog.md`.
  - Please try to follow the conventions laid out in the file. In doubt, just ask!
- [ ] Consider granting [push permissions to your PR's branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork), so maintainers can help you out if needed.
- [ ] The CI check are all passing, or I'm working on fixing them!
- [ ] I have reviewed my own code! ðŸ¤
