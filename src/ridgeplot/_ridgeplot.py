    Parameters
    ----------
    samples : Samples or ShallowSamples, optional
        If ``samples`` data is specified, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) will
        be computed. See :paramref:`kernel`, :paramref:`bandwidth`, and
        :paramref:`kde_points` for more details and KDE configuration options.
        The ``samples`` argument should be an array of shape
        :math:`(R, T_r, S_t)`. Note that we support irregular (`ragged`_)
        arrays, where:

        - :math:`R` is the number of rows in the plot
        - :math:`T_r` is the number of traces per row, where each row
          :math:`r \in R` can have a different number of traces.
        - :math:`S_t` is the number of samples per trace, where each trace
          :math:`t \in T_r` can also have a different number of samples.

        The KDE will be performed over the sample values :math:`S_t` for each
        trace :math:`t \in T`. After the KDE, the resulting array will be a (4D)
        `:paramref:`densities` array with shape :math:`(R, T_r, P_t, 2)`
        (see :paramref:`densities` below for more details).

    densities : Densities or ShallowDensities, optional
        If ``densities`` arrays are specified instead, the KDE step will be
        skipped and all associated arguments ignored. Each density array should
        have shape :math:`(R, T_r, P_t, 2)` (4D). Just like the
        :paramref:`samples` argument, we also support irregular (`ragged`_)
        ``densities`` arrays, where:

        - :math:`R` is the number of rows in the plot
        - :math:`T_r` is the number of traces per row, where each row
          :math:`r \in R` can have a different number of traces.
        - :math:`P_t` is the number of points per trace, where each trace
          :math:`t \in T_r` can also have a different number of points.
        - :math:`2` is the number of coordinates per point (x and y)

    kernel : str
        The Kernel to be used during Kernel Density Estimation. The default is
        a Gaussian Kernel (``"gau"``). Choices are:

        - ``"biw"`` for biweight
        - ``"cos"`` for cosine
        - ``"epa"`` for Epanechnikov
        - ``"gau"`` for Gaussian.
        - ``"tri"`` for triangular
        - ``"triw"`` for triweight
        - ``"uni"`` for uniform

    bandwidth : KDEBandwidth
        The bandwidth to use during Kernel Density Estimation. The default is
        ``"normal_reference"``. Choices are:

        - ``"scott"`` - 1.059 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is
          ``min(std(x),IQR/1.34)``
        - ``"silverman"`` - .9 * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where A is
          ``min(std(x),IQR/1.34)``
        - ``"normal_reference"`` - C * A * nobs ** (-1/5.), where C is
          calculated from the kernel. Equivalent (up to 2 dp) to the
          ``"scott"`` bandwidth for gaussian kernels. See `bandwidths.py`_.
        - If a float is given, its value is used as the bandwidth.
        - If a callable is given, it's return value is used. The callable
          should take exactly two parameters, i.e., ``fn(x, kern)``, and return
          a float, where:

          - ``x``: the clipped input data
          - ``kern``: the kernel instance used

    kde_points : KDEPoints
        This argument controls the points at which KDE is computed. If an
        ``int`` value is passed (default=500), the densities will be evaluated
        at ``kde_points`` evenly spaced points between the min and max of each
        set of samples. Optionally, you can also pass a custom 1D numerical
        array, which will be used for all traces.

    colorscale : str or ColorScale
        Any valid Plotly color-scale or a str with a valid named color-scale.
        Use :func:`~ridgeplot.get_all_colorscale_names()` to see which names
        are available or check out `Plotly's built-in color-scales`_.

    colormode
        This argument controls the logic for choosing the color filling of each
        ridgeline trace. Each option provides a different method for
        calculating the :paramref:`colorscale` midpoint of each trace. The
        default is mode is ``"mean-means"``. Choices are:

        - ``"row-index"`` - uses the row's index. e.g. if the ridgeplot has 3
          rows of traces, then the midpoints will be
          ``[[0, ...], [0.5, ...], [1, ...]]``.
        - ``"trace-index"`` - uses the trace's index. e.g. if the ridgeplot has
          a total of 3 traces (across all rows), then the midpoints will be
          0, 0.5, and 1, respectively.
        - ``"mean-minmax"`` - uses the min-max normalized (weighted) mean of
          each density to calculate the midpoints. The normalization min
          and max values are the minimum and maximum x-values from all
          densities, respectively.
        - ``"mean-means"`` - uses the min-max normalized (weighted) mean of
          each density to calculate the midpoints. The normalization min
          and max values are the minimum and maximum mean values from all
          densities, respectively.

    coloralpha : float, optional
        If None (default), this argument will be ignored and the transparency
        values of the specifies color-scale will remain untouched. Otherwise,
        if a float value is passed, it will be used to overwrite the
        transparency (alpha) of the color-scale's colors.

    labels : LabelsArray or ShallowLabelsArray, optional
        A list of string labels for each trace. The default value is None,
        which will result in auto-generated labels of form "Trace n". If,
        instead, a list of labels is specified, it must be of the same
        size/length as the number of traces.

    linewidth : float
        The traces' line width (in px).

    spacing : float
        The vertical spacing between density traces, which is defined in units
        of the highest distribution (i.e. the maximum y-value).

    show_annotations : bool
        Whether to show the tick labels on the y-axis. The default is True.

        .. deprecated:: 0.1.21
            Use :paramref:`show_yticklabels` instead.

    show_yticklabels : bool
        Whether to show the tick labels on the y-axis. The default is True.

        .. versionadded:: 0.1.21
            Replaces the deprecated :paramref:`show_annotations` argument.

    xpad : float
        Specifies the extra padding to use on the x-axis. It is defined in
        units of the range between the minimum and maximum x-values from all
        distributions.

    Returns
    -------
    :class:`plotly.graph_objects.Figure`
        A Plotly :class:`~plotly.graph_objects.Figure` with a ridgeline plot.
        You can further customize this figure to your liking (e.g. using the
        :meth:`~plotly.graph_objects.Figure.update_layout()` method).

    Raises
    ------
    :exc:`ValueError`
        If both :paramref:`samples` and :paramref:`densities` are specified, or
        if neither of them is specified. i.e. you may only specify one of them.
